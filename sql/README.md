## SQL Pipeline (In Progress)

This directory contains the SQL layer for the Healthcare Data Analytics project.

The SQL files reflect an incremental analytics workflow:
- Data profiling and quality checks
- Dimension table construction
- Early-stage fact table development

Not all downstream fact tables and metrics are finalized yet.  
Files are added as they are developed and validated.

### Current Status
- Profiling and core dimensions are complete
- Enterprise health fact table is in progress
- Additional fact tables and KPI logic will be added next

The intent of this repository is to show real-world, iterative analytics development rather than a polished final snapshot.

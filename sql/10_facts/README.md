## Fact Tables (Foundational)

This folder contains early-stage fact table development.

Current work focuses on enterprise-level health and stability metrics, including:
- Pipeline volume indicators
- Data completeness signals
- High-level engagement trends

These fact tables are intentionally foundational and may be extended as additional business logic, KPIs, and reporting requirements are introduced.

## Dimension Tables

This folder contains dimension table logic used across the analytics model.

Dimensions are designed to:
- Standardize descriptive attributes
- Support consistent joins across fact tables
- Reduce duplication in downstream reporting

Current dimensions include:
- Specialty
- Region
- Recruiter

Dimension logic emphasizes clean keys, trimmed text fields, and defensible grain.  
Additional dimensions may be added as the model evolves.

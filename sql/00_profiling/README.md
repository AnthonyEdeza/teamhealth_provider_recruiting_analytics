## Data Profiling & Quality Checks

This folder contains SQL scripts used to profile raw and transformed data before modeling.

These queries focus on:
- Row counts and volume checks
- Null, blank, and duplicate detection
- Basic sanity checks on key fields
- Early identification of data quality risks

Profiling outputs inform downstream modeling decisions and help ensure that dimensions and fact tables are built on reliable inputs.

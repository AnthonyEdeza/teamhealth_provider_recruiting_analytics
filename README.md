# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics – Data Quality & Engagement Analysis  
### SQL-Based Data Quality, Dimensional Modeling, and Exploratory Analysis (In Progress)

**Tech Stack:** SQL  

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare-style datasets** to assess **data quality, timeline validity, and engagement-related patterns** commonly encountered in healthcare analytics environments.

The primary objective is to validate whether the data is reliable enough to support downstream analysis and client-facing reporting.

This project is part of my transition into a **Client Data Analyst** role, with an emphasis on healthcare-adjacent analytics and real-world data challenges.

## 💼 Business Problem
Healthcare datasets often contain:
- Missing or inconsistently populated fields  
- Duplicate or conflicting records  
- Event timelines that do not follow logical sequences  

Without proper validation, reporting and insights can be misleading.  
This project addresses the early-stage analytics problem of determining **data readiness and integrity** before insights are shared.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project applies a **SQL-first analytics workflow** commonly used in production environments:

1. Perform **data quality checks** (nulls, duplicates, completeness).  
2. Validate **event sequences and timelines** for logical consistency.  
3. Build **core dimension tables** to standardize reporting attributes.  
4. Develop **foundational fact logic** to support enterprise-level health assessment.  
5. Document assumptions and known data limitations.

The focus is on **accuracy, interpretability, and analytical discipline**, not advanced modeling.

| Dimensional Modeling | Standardized descriptive attributes | SQL |
| Fact Development | Foundational enterprise health metrics | SQL |


---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **SQL-Based Data Quality Checks**  
- **Timeline and Sequence Validation**  
- **Healthcare-Style Engagement Data Context**  
- **Clear, Structured Query Logic**  
- **Production-Oriented Validation Approach**

---

## 🧱 SQL Analytics Layer

The SQL layer is organized to reflect a realistic analytics workflow, including:
- Data profiling and validation
- Dimension table construction
- Early-stage fact table development

SQL files are added incrementally as logic is developed and validated.

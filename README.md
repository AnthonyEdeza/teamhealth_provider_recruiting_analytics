# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics – Member Engagement & Data Quality  
### Exploratory Analysis and Data Validation for Healthcare-Style Datasets (In Progress)

**Tech Stack:** SQL · Python · pandas · Jupyter · GitHub  

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare-style datasets** to assess **data quality, engagement patterns, and operational trends** commonly encountered in healthcare analytics environments.

The goal is to practice the foundational work required before client-facing analytics can occur, including:
- Validating complex datasets  
- Identifying inconsistencies and anomalies  
- Exploring engagement-related patterns over time  
- Translating findings into clear, documented insights  

This project is part of my transition into a **Client Data Analyst** role, with an emphasis on healthcare-adjacent analytics and real-world data challenges.

## 💼 Business Problem
Healthcare analytics often begins with data that is:
- Incomplete or inconsistently populated  
- Collected from multiple upstream systems  
- Sensitive to timing, sequence, and data quality issues  

Without proper validation, downstream reporting and insights can be misleading or inaccurate.  
This project addresses the early-stage analytics problem of determining **whether the data itself is reliable enough to analyze**.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project applies an **analytics-first workflow** similar to what is used in production healthcare analytics teams:

1. **Assess data quality** through null checks, duplicate detection, and completeness analysis.  
2. **Validate timelines and sequences** to ensure events occur in logical order.  
3. **Explore engagement-related trends** to identify patterns, anomalies, or data gaps.  
4. **Document assumptions and limitations** to support responsible interpretation of results.  

Rather than focusing on advanced modeling, the emphasis is on **data readiness and insight credibility**.

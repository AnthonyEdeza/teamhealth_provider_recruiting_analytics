# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analytics – Data Quality & Engagement Analysis  
### SQL-Based Validation and Exploratory Analysis (In Progress)

**Tech Stack:** SQL  

---

## 🔍 Executive Summary
This project focuses on analyzing **healthcare-style datasets** to assess **data quality, timeline validity, and engagement-related patterns** commonly encountered in healthcare analytics environments.

The primary objective is to validate whether the data is reliable enough to support downstream analysis and client-facing reporting.

This project is part of my transition into a **Client Data Analyst** role, with an emphasis on healthcare-adjacent analytics and real-world data challenges.

## 💼 Business Problem
Healthcare datasets often contain:
- Missing or inconsistently populated fields  
- Duplicate or conflicting records  
- Event timelines that do not follow logical sequences  

Without proper validation, reporting and insights can be misleading.  
This project addresses the early-stage analytics problem of determining **data readiness and integrity** before insights are shared.

---

## 💡 Solution
This project applies a **SQL-first analytics workflow** commonly used in production environments:

1. Perform **data quality checks** (nulls, duplicates, completeness).  
2. Validate **event sequences and timelines** for logical consistency.  
3. Investigate **basic engagement-related patterns** to identify anomalies.  
4. Document assumptions and known data limitations.

The focus is on **accuracy, interpretability, and analytical discipline**, not advanced modeling.
